    <p style='text-align: left'> What is technology? The word ‘technology’ comes from two Greek words. 
      These words are ‘techne’ which means ‘craft’ or ‘skill’, and ‘logos’, 
      which can be translated as ‘knowledge’. So, technology is a way of putting
      theoretical knowledge into action by means of 
      skills or engineering methods.
